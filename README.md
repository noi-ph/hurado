```

Then, update NodeJS by running the following:

```shell
# uninstall NodeJS first
sudo apt remove nodejs npm
# update and upgrade linux
set -u
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
# download setup
# replace $version with the latest stable version of NodeJS
# e.g. curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_$version.x | sudo -E bash -
# install nodejs again
sudo apt install -y nodejs
```

Finally, install yarn from npm

```shell
npm install --global yarn
```

## Running the Web Server

1. Move to the `web-server` directory (`cd web-server`)
2. Run `npm docker:dev`
3. Wait a few minutes for it to download needed stuff. You should get a bunch of messages like:

```bash
# This is downloading the necessary images from the itnernet
Pulling db_postgres (postgres:14.2-alpine)...
...
Status: Downloaded newer image for node:16.14.0-alpine
...
# This is building the web-server specific image
Step 5/9 : RUN npm install && npm cache clean --force

db_boilerplate         | 2022-07-31 08:44:36.706 UTC [1] LOG:  listening on IPv6 address "::", port 5432
...
# This is web-server running
be_boilerplate         | [INFO] 08:44:45 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.6.4)
be_boilerplate         | Server running on port 4000
be_boilerplate         | Database connection success. Connection name: 'default' Database: 'boilerplate'
```

Once you see  that final Server running on port 4000, that means your server is running. You can test it by opening your browser and going to localhost:4000 and you should see this "ðŸ’Š RESTful API boilerplate"

## Running the Web Client

1. Move to the web-client directory and run npm install
2. Wait a few minutes for it to install.
3. Run npm run dev and it should work. 

You should see this message:

`ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000`
