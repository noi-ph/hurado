# Hurado

NOI.PH's Online Judge

## Development

### Recommended Specs

- RAM: 8 GB or more
- CPU: Intel i3 or better

### Getting Started

If you're using Windows, we recommend [using WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to emulate a Unix environment. If you haven't yet, [set up your own SSH-key and add it to your SSH-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

#### Fork the repository

Fork the Hurado repository with the help of [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

#### Clone your fork of the repository

Before cloning your fork of the repository, make sure that you have added your SSH-key to your SSH-agent. You can clone the repository by running the following command:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:your_username/hurado.git
```

#### Setup Docker

Download the [installer for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/release-notes/#docker-desktop-430) and install it. If you're using WSL 2, enable the following options: ![Docker WSL Settings](./docs/readme-docker-wsl-settings.png)

## Running the Web Server

1. Move to the `hurado` directory (`cd hurado`)
2. Run the code below. Don't worry about the version of your NodeJS, this environment was set up so that the Docker container works it out for you.

```shell
$ . scripts/run-backend.sh
```

3. After a bunch of messages, you'll eventually see the following:

```shell
hurado-backend  | [INFO] 08:44:45 ts-node-dev ver. 1.1.8 (using ts-node ver. 9.1.1, typescript ver. 4.6.4)
hurado-backend  | Server running on port 4000
```

4. If you haven't yet, run the following:

```shell
$ . scripts/migration-run.sh
$ . scripts/seed.sh
```

5. Visit https://localhost:4000 and you'll see "ðŸ’Š RESTful API boilerplate." You could also play around with the API at https://localhost:4000/doc

### Useful Web Server Scripts

`. scripts/backend-bash.sh` - Get a bash shell into the web server. Useful for installing or updating dependencies through `npm install`, as well as random debugging.

`. scripts/frontend-bash.sh` - Get a bash shell into the web client. Useful for installing or updating dependencies through `npm install`, as well as random debugging.

`. scripts/sql.sh` - Get into a psql shell on the hurado-postgres container.

`. scripts/migration-revert.sh` - Revert the lastest migration.

`. scripts/migration-run.sh` - Run all the migrations in `web-server/src/orm/migrations`.

`. scripts/seed.sh` - Seed the database with dummy data.

`. scripts/openapi-generate.sh` - Generate OpenAPI types for both the web client and server.

## Running the Web Client

1. Move to the `hurado` directory, if you aren't there already (`cd hurado`)
2. Run the code below. Don't worry about the version of your NodeJS, this environment was set up so that the Docker container works it out for you.

```shell
$ . scripts/run-frontend.sh
```

3. After a bunch of messages, you'll eventually see the following:

```shell
hurado-frontend  | ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
```

4. Visit https://localhost:3000 to view the web client!
